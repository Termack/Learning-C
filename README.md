<h1 align="center">Learning-C</h1>


This repository contains my collection of simple C programming examples, made to help to learn the C programming language as well as the creation of algorithms.

All programs should be easily campiled and run on Linux based machines, as not tested on Windows shouldn't fail though.

### Compile and Run

Simple compilation.

#### GCC
> gcc file.c -o outputfile 

Kernel Linux

> ./outputfile

Or

> gcc file.c && ./a.out

Windows

> \> outputfile
