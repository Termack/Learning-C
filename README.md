<h1 align="center">Learning-C</h1>


This repository contains my collection of simple C programming examples, made to help to learn the C programming language as well as the creation of algorithms.

The idea is that all the codes are simple to understand because they have comments explaining line by line. Small codes and beginner friendly.

All programs should be easily campiled and run on Linux based machines, as not tested on Windows shouldn't fail though.

Feel free to open a pull request to fix any issues or include any new code.
