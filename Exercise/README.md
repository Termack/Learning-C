# Excercise

Exercises that can be used to practice, the resolutions within the files can be read after completion or in times of not knowing how to resolve.

These are the ways I found to complete the exercises, there may be better ways to reach the same results.

---
```
1 - Make an algorithm that receives a number and shows a message if that number is greater than 10.
```
```
2 - Make an algorithm that receives two numbers and shows in ascending order.
```
```
3 - Make an algorithm that asks for a number and shows if the number is pair or inpair.
```
```
4 - Create a program that receives a number and inform if it is a multiple of 10.
```
```
5 - make an algorithm that receives two numbers and shows in ascending order, or shows a message if they are equal.

```
```
6 - Write a program that asks for an integer.
Display an error message if the number entered is between 15 and 25 or between 45 and 50.
```
```
7 - Make an algorithm that receives a number and shows a message if this number is greater than 80, less than 25 or equal to 40.
```
```
8 - Increment the previous exercise, in case the measures 
form a valid triangle, inform which type of triangle they form: equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
```
```
9 - Remake the previous exercise now showing right triangle.
```
```
10 - Make an algorithm that draws a number from one to ten and gives the user two chances to hit it.
```
```
11 - Update the previous algorithm now making it possible to inform if the number is greater or less than the attempt.
```
```
12 - Update the previous algorithm now with 3 attempts.
```
